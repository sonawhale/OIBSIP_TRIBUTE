          <h2>The Father of Nation.</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), 
              Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule
              of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of 
               nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.
              In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). 
              The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; 
              he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” 
              His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most 
              universally recognized on earth.

              Civil Disobedience Movement at Champaran 
              <p>
                In Champaran, Gandhi led a non-violent civil disobedience movement against the landlords to provide some relief to the farmers.
               His obstinate nature forced the British to sign an agreement that gave some freedom to the farmers. This was his first victory
                in India. The atrocities of the British were increasing and it was very difficult to challenge British rule. 
                It so happened that when he came to India after a successful satyagraha for Indians in Africa against the British, a smile appeared on the faces of Indians.

              Kheda Satyagraha - The Tax Revolt of Kheda
              <p>
                The year 1918 was traumatic for the Kheda district of Gujarat as the region was hit by floods and famine. 
                The farmers there suffered huge losses but the British refused to free them from taxes. Gandhi, along with Vallabhbhai Patel, 
                encouraged the peasants to protest by non-payment of taxes. Kheda is a place which is in Gujarat. Just like there was a peasant 
                movement in Champaran, after that a peasant movement also took place in Kheda (Gujarat) in 1918 AD.

              Non-cooperation Movement
              <p>
                Gandhiji started the non-cooperation movement on August 1, 1920. After the Jallianwala Bagh incident in Amritsar, Gandhi urged the entire country to participate in the non-cooperation movement.
                 According to the movement, Indians would no longer buy British goods and would also boycott their schools and colleges. 
                 Basically, everything that the British did their part to make. It saw the participation of various sections of Indian society and 
                 demonstrated the spirit of non-violent non-cooperation against British rule.

              Salt Satyagraha Salt March
              <p>
                Although there were many movements to get freedom in India, but one such movement took place which shook the roots of British
                 rule. The name of this movement was Salt Movement Namak Andolan was started by Mahatma Gandhi on 12 March 1930 from Sabarmati 
                 Ashram near Ahmedabad.  This movement was run from Ahmedabad Sabarmati 
                 Ashram to Dandi in Gujarat for 400 kms.

              Quit India Movement
              <p>
                During World War II, Gandhi declared that he would no longer ask Indians to obey the British and participate in the war. 
                He called for the Quit India Movement in 1942 where he declared that the British should immediately leave India and give the 
                Indians the freedom they are entitled to. This eventually led to the independence of India.
                Quit India Movement-1942 was one of the major movements of Gandhiji.
